    "### Mathematical Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA, public-key or asymmetric cryptography, involves a **public key** and a **private key** for encryption and decryption. The basic intention is that a message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted in a reasonable amount of time by using the private key. \n",
    "\n",
    "A basic mathematic principle behind RSA is modular arithmetic. With a public key represented by the integers $e$ and $n$; and a private key $d$ together with $n$, a message $m$ can be encrypted to cipher text $c$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ c \\equiv m^e \\mod{n} $\n",
    "\n",
    "and the message $m$ can be recovered again from the cipher text $c$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ m \\equiv c^d \\mod{n} $\n",
    "\n",
    "While $e$ and $n$ as public key are available to everyone, the private key $d$ must be kept secret and cannot be figured out easily. The integer $n$ is a composite number from two prime numbers (i.e. $n = p \\cdot q$) and must be chosen in the way so that its prime factors (i.e. $p$ and $q$) cannot be factorized easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "The security of RSA depends mainly on two hard problems:\n",
    "- **prime factorization** \n",
    " - finding prime numbers $p$ and $q$ so that $n = p \\cdot q$\n",
    "- **modular discrete logarithm calculation**\n",
    " - finding $x$ from $a = b^x$ with given $a$ and $b$"
